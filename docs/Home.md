# PowerAuth Web Flow Customization

The purpose of this project is to provide client specific customization, such as adapting to client backend APIs, CSS customization, updated texts, images, fonts and other changes required for customizing Web Flow for clients.

Web Flow can be customized in following areas:

- Appearance (texts, CSS, fonts and images) - chapter [Customizing Web Flow Appearance](./Customizing-Web-Flow-Appearance.md)
- Integration with clients backends - chapter [Implementing the Data Adapter Interface](./Implementing-the-Data-Adapter-Interface.md)

Data Adapter is integrated with Web Flow using REST API. For documentation see: [Data Adapter REST API Reference](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-webflow/blob/develop/docs/Data-Adapter-REST-API-Reference.md)
